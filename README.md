# EvoSplit

**EvoSplit** presents a new approach for the distribution of multi-label data sets into disjoint subsets for supervised machine learning. Currently, data set providers either divide a data set randomly or using iterative stratification [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2), a method that tries to maintain the labels (or label pairs) distribution of the original data set into the different subsets. Following this objective, EvoSplit offers two evolutionary approaches: First, a single-objective evolutionary algorith that aims at obtaining a split that maximises the similarity between those distributions independently. Second, a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to maximise the similarity considering simultaneously both distributions (labels and label pairs). **EvoSplit** improves the splitting of a data set in comparison to the iterative stratification.

## New train/validation/test splits of well-known multi-label datasets

* Microsoft COCO - Panoptic Segmentation Task: [New splits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MzD2JbFWKe0jHSQJtMYxDf-kUgURrr3r?usp=sharing). The original data set can be downloaded from the [Microsoft COCO dataset website](https://cocodataset.org/#download).
* Tencent ML-Images: I offer [new splits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GsEbwfQmVEIKKF06QiFWggCnm9Elef3i?usp=sharing) for both the ImageNet and OpenImages subsets. The original dataset can be downloaded from the [Tencent ML-Images repository](https://github.com/Tencent/tencent-ml-images).
